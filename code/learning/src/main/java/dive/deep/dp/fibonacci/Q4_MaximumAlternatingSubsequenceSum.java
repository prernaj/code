/**
 * Question
 * The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.
 * For example, the alternating sum of [4,2,5,3] is (4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4.
 * Given an array nums, return the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of nums (after reindexing the elements of the subsequence).
 * A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) 
 * without changing the remaining elements' relative order.

 /**
  * Input Output
  * nums = [4,2,5,3] => 7 {4,2,5}
  * nums = [5,6,7,8] => 8 {8}
  * nums = [6,2,1,2,4,5] => 10 {6,1,5}
