Basic Template
Step1: 
Have a counter or hash-map to count specific array input and keep on increasing the window toward right using outer loop.

Step2: 
Have a while loop inside to reduce the window side by sliding toward right. 
Movement will be based on constraints of problem. Go through few examples below

Step3: 
Store the current maximum window size or minimum window size or number of windows based on problem requirement.
