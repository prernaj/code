/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/split-bst/
 * Question
 * Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer target, 
 * split the tree into two subtrees where one subtree has nodes that are all smaller or equal to the target value, 
 * while the other subtree has all nodes that are greater than the target value. 
 * It Is not necessarily the case that the tree contains a node with the value target.
 * Additionally, most of the structure of the original tree should remain. 
 * Formally, for any child c with parent p in the original tree, if they are both in the same subtree after the split, then node c should still have the parent p.
 * Return an array of the two roots of the two subtrees.
